This game requires two players (or hands). Use keys "A" and "D" to move the left paddle left and right.
Use arrow keys left and right to move the right paddle left and right.
The objective of the game is to defeat the enemies and progress through the stages. 
Don't let your health drop to 0 or else you lose.
Try to avoid the attacks from the enemies as they will damage you. Pick up power-ups to help you defeat the enemies!

Power-Ups:

Heart: Heals yourself for 25 health
Blue Potion: Creates another ball
Green Potion: Increases the size of your paddle for 6 seconds
Gold: Increases your gold

Known Bugs:

* Even though the paddles are perfectly flat, the balls do not always bounce correctly
* Sometimes the ball gets stuck under the paddle (To fix this just move the paddle but you will lose some health)
* Sometimes the paddle will tilt to one side.
* Sometimes the enemies will not be damaged when struck by the ball
* When the players win the game, the backdrop changes to that of a desk in a room.
  A wizard should appear to tell the players their score (gold) but the score is never displayed.
  I do not know the reason for this bug. The algorithms seem correct.
